# Plastic Waste Image Classification

A machine learning project to classify types of plastic waste using image recognition. This project aims to assist in automating the recycling process by accurately identifying various plastic types for better sorting and waste management.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: Upload an image through a website to classify the type of plastic waste.
- **Camera-Based Classification**: Uses OpenCV to capture live camera images and classify them in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- **OpenCV**: For camera integration and real-time classification.
- **Flask/Django**: (Choose one) Backend framework to serve the web interface.
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS and JavaScript for a simple user-friendly UI.

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py


## 🚀 Usage

1. **🌐 Web Interface:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000` to open the web app.
   - Upload an image of plastic waste to classify it.

2. **📷 Camera-Based Classification:**
   - Run the OpenCV script:
     ```bash
     python camera_classification.py
     ```
   - This will open the camera and classify plastic types in real-time.
